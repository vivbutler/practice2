Here is what I understand so far about it:

1. Create a new branch > Makes a copy the Master (Branches are used to experiment and make edits before commiting them to master)

2. Make and Commit changes ( add a description)

3. Open a Pull Request, click Create pull Request (for review and merge) Name it, describe

4. Create Pull Request 

5. Merge Pull Request, confirm, 
   â€¢ Delete the Branch
